# Timbre watermarking model
This is the complete code of the watermarking model part. Visit our [website](https://timbrewatermarking.github.io/samples.html) for audio samples.


# How to use
## Dependencies

You can setup the conda environment and install the Python dependencies with
```
git clone https://github.com/TimbreWatermarking/TimbreWatermarking.git
cd TimbreWatermarking/watermarking_model
conda create -n timbrewatermark python=3.8.13
source activate timbrewatermark
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
You may need to manually install the appropriate version of pytorch following the rules from [pytorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/previous-versions).

## Dataset

You need to download the dataset used in the paper and extract it to an appropriate location.
You can use the script provided here to automatically download and process the [LibriSpeech dataset](https://www.openslr.org/12):
```
cd dataset 
sh ./sh.sh
```
For the [LJSpeech dataset](https://data.keithito.com/data/speech/LJSpeech-1.1.tar.bz2), you can download it manually. 



## Inference

Modify 'raw_path' in `config/train.yaml` to point to your LibriSpeech path. The file structure is as follows, and the complete file structure can be found in `dataset/LibriSpeech_wav_structure.txt`.
```

### Common test

For testing the impact of different peprocessing operations on the speech quality and robustness, run
```
python common_test.py -n "experiments_results" \
                      -p config/process.yaml \
                      -m config/model.yaml \
                      -t config/train.yaml
```
This will take some time, as it is designed to test the effects on all 2620 audio segments in Librispeech under various attack scenarios.


### Voice Cloning test

First, perform watermark embedding by embedding `watermark-0` (the first watermark in `results/wmpool.txt`) into LJSpeech and saving them.
```
python embed_and_save.py --wm 0 \
                         -o "original/ljspeech/wavs/path/" \
                         -s "saving/watermarked/ljspeech/path/" \
                         -mp "checkpoint/path/" \
                         -p config/process.yaml \
                         -m config/model.yaml \
                         -t config/train.yaml
```

Then, we train each voice cloning model using the watermarked dataset, i.e., Tacotron2, Fastspeech2, VITS, or fine-tune HifiGAN. We have provided the source code used for training each model, available [here](https://github.com/TimbreWatermarking/TimbreWatermarking/tree/main/voice.clone). Additionally, detailed explanations on how to perform cloning on PaddleSpeech and Voice-Clone-App, as well as corresponding model examples, are also provided there.


After completing the cloning, you can use the following command to extract watermarks from the generated cloned voice:
```
python extract.py -p config/process.yaml \
                  -m config/model.yaml \
                  -t config/train.yaml \
                  -mp "checkpoint/path/" \
                  -tp "path/to/target/audios"
```


## Training

You can use the following command to retrain the watermarking model:
```
python train.py -p config/process.yaml -m config/model.yaml -t config/train.yaml
```

# Update for flexibility: watermark strength factor
Just like the version of the model that resists watermark overwriting, we can also add a watermark strength factor to the base model by simply multiplying the watermark feature by a weight. The higher the weight, the stronger the robustness of the watermark, but the corresponding auditory quality will decrease. Below is an example with the watermark embedded at `1.1` times the weight. We also recommend removing the skip concatenate in the encoder to simplify the processing flow when utilizing this flexibility, with the corresponding model checkpoint available [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1YdFcGwZbSf5DoDjXYFi2CVwvNHh-zXYq?usp=drive_link).
```
python embed_and_save_with_strength.py --wm 0 \
                                       -o "original/ljspeech/wavs/path/" \
                                       -s "saving/watermarked/ljspeech/path/" \
                                       -mp "model2/checkpoint/path/" \
                                       -p config/process.yaml -m config/model.yaml -t config/train.yaml \
                                       --strength_factor 1.1
```
The extraction process remains the same, but be sure to use the corresponding model ckpt file.
